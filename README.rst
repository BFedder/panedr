Panedr
======

|Build Status| |cov|

Panedr reads a `Gromacs EDR`_ binary energy XDR file and returns its content
as a pandas_ dataframe. The library exposes three functions:

- the ``edr_to_df`` function, which gets the path to an EDR file and returns a
  pandas DataFrame,

- the ``edr_to_dict`` function, which returns a dictionary of NumPy arrays instead
  of a pandas DataFrame

- and the ``read_edr`` function, which is called by the other two functions to
  do the actual reading of EDR files. It returns a tuple of lists.

``panedr`` is compatible with Python 3.6 and greater.

Example
-------

.. code:: python

    import panedr

    # Read the EDR file
    path = 'ener.edr'
    df = panedr.edr_to_df(path)
    dic = panedr.edr_to_dict(path)

    # The `verbose` optional parameter can be set to True to display the
    # progress on stderr
    df = panedr.edr_to_df(path, verbose=True)
    dic = panedr.edr_to_dict(path, verbose=True)

    # Get the average pressure after the first 10 ns
    pressure_avg = df['Pressure'][df['Time'] > 10000].mean()
    pressure_avg = dic['Pressure'][dic['Time'] > 10000].mean()


Install
-------
Install panedr ``pip``:

.. code:: bash

    pip install panedr


If you are using `conda`_ and `conda-forge`_, you can install with

.. code:: bash

    conda install -c conda-forge panedr

Tests
-----

The ``panedr`` repository contains a series of tests. If you downloaded or
cloned the code from the repository, you can run the tests. To do so,
install `pytest`_, and, in the directory of the
panedr source code, run:

.. code:: bash

    pytest -v tests


panedrlite
----------
Under the hood, panedr is just a metapackage that installs panedrlite and
the requirements for all functions, notably including pandas. To avoid requiring
pandas in downstream applications, panedrlite is available for installation as
well. It provides all functionality, except that pandas is not automatically
installed as a dependency, and therefore :func:`edr_to_df` will not work
out-of-the-box unless it is installed manually. `panedrlite` also uses the panedr
namespace, so `import panedr` works. 


.. code:: bash

    pip install panedrlite
